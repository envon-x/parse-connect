# parse_connect package for Flutter

Parse_Connect is a package that provides Parse client functionality for Flutter. It is currently based on , and developed against,  a Parse server setup on [Back4App](http://www.back4app.com). This first release is limited and provides basic functionality for:

- *Object*
- *User*

With it you should be able to create, edit, update and delete Objects as well as signing up, updating, deleting and logging on Users.

This is currently **VERY MUCH** Work in Progress.


## Example Usage
As I **eat my own dog food** (never did like that phrase, but it kinda fits) I will put some code snippets on the [project Wiki here] (https://github.com/magnatronus/parse-connect/wiki).



## Getting Started
